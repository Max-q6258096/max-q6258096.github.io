I like using photoshop but I also really enjoy just working with the pictures and using them as they are when I take them. I think that editing in post objectively can make the picture better in whatever aspect you desire but it also removes a level of magic and integrity from the image as it existed when it was originally taken. I like keeping the photo as it is when I originally took it because I feel that it is better to embrace whatever mistakes and/or aspects that could be improved be left in the picture because that captures the reality of the photo as it was taken rather than having a product that was manufactured to create a slightly new image based on an existing photo. 

Depth of field is a concept I find somewhat confusing, I usually just try to keep everything in the photograph in focus, and to my understanding depth of field is something that is defined by having parts of the photo in focus while other parts are not in focus. I really like photography and in my mind I try to achieve the effects of depth of field through lighting instead of through focus. If I want one part of the photo to be centralized or to stand out I will try to capture that in better and more attractive lighting in addition to trying to aesthetically put that part of the picture in a part of the frame that will be more natural to draw the viewer's attention.
