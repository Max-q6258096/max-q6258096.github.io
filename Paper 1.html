Sontag expresses a lot of interesting ideas around photography both as an art and as a tool of communication. Marshall McLuhan is a writer who has had a lot of impact on me and one of his core ideas was ‘The medium is the message’, meaning in simple terms that the medium of the art itself dictates the art itself. I think that Sontag understands and expresses the idea well that photography is a medium that dictates itself through the essence of time, a photograph must be captured at a real point and place in time and any recreation of said photo re-capures and replicates a fracture of that moment. Walter Benjamin wrote about that idea in his book Illuminations and Art in the age of mechanical reproduction. I think that these three writers share a lot of ideas in common and by using multiple of their ideas together we can learn a lot from them about the nature of photography and art in the current day and age. Sontag talks alot about the ethics of photography which I found interesting, I thought about the current genocide occuring in gaza and how both the perpetrators of the genocide and the victims of it are able to document through photos and videos and those pieces of media are able to spread throughout the internet. Propaganda is able to exist in increasingly more and more complex, nuanced, and manipulative ways as technology and our ways of communication advance, and examining how our understanding of the world of politics and current events is created through consuming media like photography or videos can tell us a lot about the medium itself. Sontag also writes about the nature of truth within photographs which I find to be a bit irritating. I think there is a false presumption of truth within photography, as even if a photo is staged, at least parts of it had to exist in realty, even though post-production manipulation of photos has existed since the beginning of photography itself. All forms of visual and written media that we have used since the begging of time have been deceitful, we had used painting and drawings to communicate images to each other and those were manipulated when presented as truthful as are photographs. Overall I disagree with Sontag about alot of her stances around how photography changed the nature of truth and the forms in which we consume violence through media, I think that this part of human nature can be seen throughout visual media for thousands of years, photography was just a medium that was easy to create and reproduce. The printing press can be compared to photography in this way in in it’s impact on reproduction of media. What makes photography unique is it’s ability to capture a moment of time and space through means that can be inherently truthful, but as Sontag points out aren’t absolutely truthful, but nonetheless the ability to capture aspects of physical life through the capture of light itself is something incredible. Although today everything is digitilized, there is still something amazing about the ability to capture moments of life and perspective to be shared and revisited.
