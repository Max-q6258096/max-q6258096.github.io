  <h1>Raw Before</h1>
<img src="RAWBEFORE.jpg"  style="width:100%; height:auto;">

  <h2>Raw After</h2>
<img src="RAW_AFTER.jpg"  style="width:100%; height:auto;">

  <p> 
  I used this picture because it had alot of darkness in the background and I wanted to see how I could edit and play with the element in the raw file along with the color of the flowers.
