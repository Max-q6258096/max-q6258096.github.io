  <h1>Image Blur</h1>
<img src="BLUR.jpg"  style="width:100%; height:auto;">

  <p>
This picture uses reflection again, I wanted to use the blur effect to add more blur to the right side of the picture to add more focus and emphasis to the red mannequin while still keeping the white mannequin, the reflection of the advertisement of the acrobatic woman in focus. And I wanted to make the central figure of the man looking into the window half in focus and half blurred.   <p>
