I really enjoy photography and working with photoshop. I have a GH5 camera that I really enjoy using for photography and videos. Overall I enjoy working with videos and Premiere then I do working with photos and Photoshop, but I really love working with both. I have experience with Photoshop and using a DSLR camera before so I didn’t learn anything new in this assignment, but I am really enjoying being able to find a way to display my work onto another medium. I hope that by the end of the class I will be able to become good enough with working with Github that I can create my own website for my work, I don’t use social media, so it would be really nice for me to have a space where I can look at my work and share it with others. I would really like to learn how to make the website more visually appealing and be able to add more to it, but it is really challenging to learn how to code but it is something that I hope will become easier as I learn more about it. I think that figuring out a way to navigate through all my work through an interestingly designed website could be really exciting. I have lots of photographs and it would be really cool to be able to navigate through them all in an exciting way like a website I designed rather then just looking at them through files on my computer like I usually have to do.
