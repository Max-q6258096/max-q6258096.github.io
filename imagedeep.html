I think this photo captures a really interesting contrast between two distinct planes of vision and field in a 3d space. The bright, front-facing brick wall and the shadowed side that leads down the street and below-ground area. The line of parked cars creates a sense of depth and almost gives the still image a feeling of motion. I think this is a good example of showing dynamic 3-D spaces in 2-D spaces like pictures.
