I think that Malik provides a lot of thoughtful and important points in her article. I agree with her that there is a lot of concerning trends recently regarding AI image generation and how it is affecting U.S. politics and culture. When she wrote about the overwhelming amount of slop on Facebook specifically and discussed how it can become overwhelming and a sensory overload to some users it made me wish she went more into the different audience around social media, specifically regarding age and content, as it is a defining factor of the AI slop she is discussing. The AI slop for an older person using facebook will be very different then the AI slop a younger person will find on a platform like TikTok. Old people on facebook are also far more likely to not be able to differentiate between AI slop and a non-AI post. 

I think another important aspect of examining AI slop and it’s effects are by comparing it to what could have been achieved with photoshop. Photoshop can achieve a large majority of what current AI is doing excluding video, although with more time and the use of other programs and a pre-requisite skill set the same thing that AI is currently doing could be achieved through image and video editing. The main difference and the most important one in my mind is that AI is fast and relatively efficient, and becoming more and more effective over time at very fast rates. 

AI videos tend to have a strange visual aesthetic to them that I think soulless is a good descriptor for, however the recent AI video model Sora 2 in my opinion has largely removed this soulless visual aspect from a lot of the videos being produced and instead creating products that generally are able to capture the essential visual aspects of the medium it is copying be it Iphone camera quality, CCTV footage, or security camera footage. This will make it harder for all of us to distinguish between natural video and AI produced video. 

I really disagree with Malik when she says that is has become impossible to curate one’s own feed on social media, as someone that uses social media actively i find myself encountering a lot of AI generated content but by no means have I lost the ability to curate my own feed. I am still able to find many distinctly human creators, however it is obvious that the larger media landscape is becoming increasingly more dominated by AI sources. I think that ultimately AI will prevail and that social media will go through a mass transformation that could possibly result in a mass exodus by users who are interested in non-AI material, hopefully a solution will arise where a new social media platform can exclude AI, but the possibility of that happening is speculative and the current trend of how we interact with the internet and social media with AI is difficult to understand or predict the future of.
